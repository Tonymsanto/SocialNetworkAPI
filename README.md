# SocialNetworkAPI

## Description
This project is for social networking. Unfortuntely, I ran out of time to turn this in and could not debug in order to run on local host and get it loaded to insomnia. I thought my code was fine, and could not figure out the problem. As I said unfortuntely it the end of my class and I was not able to get help in office hours. I have added a video showing the error when `npm start` is ran.
