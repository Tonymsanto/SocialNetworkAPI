## Installation
In order to install, I used `npm i` and this will install the needed dependencies.

## Usage
The first step is to use the command `mysql -u root` and this will start up MySQL. After that you need to run the schema which will be `source db/schema.sql;`. Once all that is done you can do the two command lines of `npm run seed` and then `npm start`. After that, insomnia is used to test the routes.
